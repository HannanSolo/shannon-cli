Proposed encrypted file layout:

[
  IV (initialization vector) for KDF
  key derivation parameters
  hash of derived secret
]
[
  IV for cipher,
  ciphertext = encrypt( M, KDF( password ) )
]





Go workspaces

GOPATH env variable - typically ~/go
GOROOT env variable - typically /usr/local/go


$GOPATH/src/pkg/foo



Go project layout possibilities:

    foo/
       main.go - package main   - 
       ...
       
       enc/
          enc.go - package enc   import "foo/enc"
          blah_test.go - package enc, package enc_test
